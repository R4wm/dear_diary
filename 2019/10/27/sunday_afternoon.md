<p><b><left><a href=1/5?json=false> 5</a> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; </b></p>

<p><b><left><a href=1/6?json=false> 6</a> That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. </b></p>

<p><b><left><a href=1/7?json=false> 7</a> For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. </b></p>


### Notes

1. Philemon had a church in his house  
   Paul is thanking God for their love and faith toward Jesus and all saints while praying   
   
   That the communication of thy faith may become effectual
       When you have a problem with a brother or sister, check your relationship with Jesus.   
       
   Verse 7: Philemon was a blessing to the saints  
   
   Verse 8: Paul could command, but is asking (beseeching)  
   
   Verse 10: Paul shared the Gospel with Onesimus who was saved bc of it  
   
   Verse 11: something happened with Onesimus where maybe he crossed Philemon  
   
   Verse 18: Paul is asking Philemon to accept and forgive Onesimus for whatever and to treat Onesimus as himself.  
   Verse 21: Its interesting to note that the saints Paul is writing to did more than expected historically.  
   
   
>Contrast with
```
2TIMOTHY 4 : 10
For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
```

Dont look at people for what they are, but see what they can be..

### Take Away

>Anyone can be an Onesimus  

Paul is basically saying, 
I like what your doing  
I could command you to take this dude in, but rather am asking you  
I know he crossed you in the past  
But take him in as you would me  
If he owes you anything, put it on my tab for I will repay it  
Prepare a housing for me, bc i believe if you pray for it, God will deliver me to you  

>Anyone can be a Demus  

Demus hath forsaken me
