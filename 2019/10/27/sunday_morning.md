### Notes
There is much in here about the church  
>Text
    [Ephesians](https://mintz5.com/bible/ephesians/1)

>The church is Gods plan, JEsus gave himself for it!
    This is like saying I love Jesus but I hate his bride..  
    This is like saying you like me but you hate my wife..  

    
You are part of the Body of Christ
```
EPHESIANS 3 : 6
That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

EPHESIANS 5 : 30
For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
```
The whole body is supposed to work together
```
EPHESIANS 4 : 16
From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
```

* How the church is supposed to operate  
  https://mintz5.com/bible/EPHESIANS/5?json=false

The church is very important to God
```
EPHESIANS 5 : 25
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;

HEBREWS 10 : 25
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
```
> so much the more...

People including my self think they know whats best when it comes to the church
* Seek God and not your own understanding
```
PROVERBS 28 : 26
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.

PROVERBS 12 : 15
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.
```

Even the (false) prophets would turn away the heart of the people (those who would say you dont need church)
```
JEREMIAH 23 : 17
They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.

2TIMOTHY 3:4
Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
```

The church of Corinth had over 20 MAJOR doctrinal problems  
This church was full of problems  
Never did Paul recommend that people leave the church  

Paul did say to remove 1 from the church over sin  
```
1CORINTHIANS 5:5
To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
```

People are gonna be rude and hurt your feeling in church  
This does not mean you should leave the church  
```
JOB 23:12
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.

2TIMOTHY 2:3
Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
```

Dont seperate from the flock
```
1PETER 5:8
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
```
Seeking!!  

He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool!
```
PROVERBS 28:26
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
```

Church is not a place of entertainment  
Its a place where Gods word is to be studied and where God is to be worshipped  
Bring others in that they may learn the Grace of God and get saved from their sins like every christian was  


You dont find lone ranger christians
    * Note to self: Why do I feel that way?
    

Dont forsake the assembly (the church gathering)  

### Take Away
There are some things I personally dont like about the church I attend.  
This is a problem I have, and Im the one who is wrong.  
Since the church is Gods will, pray about what it is I dont like (mostly people)  
* They walked in the imagination of their own heart
  I need to seek God about this
  All churches have problems bc they have people..
  lol, this was already answered for me during the sermon.  
  
Church is not optional for the Christian (who wants to obey God)  
God loved it enough he gave himself for it  

  ```
  PROVERBS 28 : 26
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
