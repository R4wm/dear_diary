# what is *good fruits*

[Matthew 7](https://cdn.mintz5.com/801A6BD/linode/bible/matthew/7)
```
15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

```
Ye shall know them by their fruits..  
I believe that `good fruits` is not talking about just good deeds.  
`good fruits` has to do with bringing souls the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.  
Anything else is void.

{
  "Book": "MARK",
  "Chapter": 8,
  "Verse": 36,
  "Text": "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
  }
```
If `good fruits` was just doing good works like feeding the poor, or caring for the sick, then good works would merit your way into heaven, which the bible clearly teaches is not true.  
[And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.](https://cdn.mintz5.com/801A6BD/linode/bible/MATTHEW/3/10)  

Those who have done *good works* and the result thereof..
```
22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?

23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
```

The `good fruit` that was provided to those who will enter heaven was the gospel of Jesus Christ that he died so that I could be saved..  
```
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
```
Yes we are commanded to do good works unto others and be a shining light, but this is without power if not first commissioned.

Lord help me to take joy in your salvation always.  
Help me to be a people person for your name sake yet uncomprimising.  
I pray that you would equip me to rescue others from the lies and deception of this world while there is time.  
Humble me oh Lord, help me to listen and see.  
Teach me to love like you loved.
