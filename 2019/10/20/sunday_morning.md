# The Rules

1. First base is salvation
```json
{
  "Book": "MATTHEW",
  "Chapter": 7,
  "Verse": 23,
  "Text": "And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
  }
```
    * They missed first base...
    

2. Second base is seperation


3. Thrid base is service
```
22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
```


4. Fourth base is Home..

```
13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:

14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
```

*Many people will take the broad way that leads to destruction.

### Notes
---

Many people believe that  by doing services, they can get to heaven
    this is not true, for by grace are ye saved..
    
Many poeple believe that 

Many people will stand before God thinking everything is ok. (because they didnt understand Gods plan of salvation)

Pride can stop a person from getting saved:
    The preacher mentioned when he was young in a methodist church, he realized that from Gods word, he was not actually saved. 
    He had just learned about it, but was too embarrased to get saved at that time..
    He told his friend about it, and his friend said "Lets take care of that right now"
    The preacher had touched all other bases, but missed first base
    
    
Its the death burial and ressurection of Jesus Christ

```

1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;

4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
```

* Believe
```json
{
  "Book": "ACTS",
  "Chapter": 16,
  "Verse": 31,
  "Text": "And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."
  }

```

```json
{
  "Book": "JOHN",
  "Chapter": 3,
  "Verse": 18,
  "Text": "He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."
  }

```

```json

{
  "Book": "ROMANS",
  "Chapter": 10,
  "Verse": 9,
  "Text": "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."
  }
```

```json
{
  "Book": "JOHN",
  "Chapter": 1,
  "Verse": 12,
  "Text": "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:"
  }

```

* Its sooooo simple..
* Second base and third base will never get anyone to heaven..
* You must first believe 

This actually happened, he missed first base

1953 Joe Bill Addcock

* If you made it to heaven, its the direct result of touching first base..
