    ```json
    {
    "Book": "1PETER",
    "Chapter": 1,
    "Verse": 7,
    "Text": "That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:"
    }
    ```
    

3. Glory:

This is an attitude thing:
    ```
    {
  "Book": "JAMES",
  "Chapter": 1,
  "Verse": 2,
  "Text": "My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;"
  }
    ```
    
For the child of God there still ought to be a spirit of joy
    The tyring of your faith worketh patience.
    

* God sends us trials on purpose, we need to give them back to him (From the musical special)

### Take Away
Your Attitude Matters:
    If your attitude is good, its gonna be just fine.
    If your attitude is bad, it will eat you alive
    You can have a good attitude through anything, you have so many resources
    ```json
    {
    "Book": "PSALMS",
    "Chapter": 51,
    "Verse": 12,
    "Text": "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit."
    }
    ```
Your attitude will reflect on how affective you can be at being able to reach people (its a critical thing to be able to reach people so they can shun eternal seperation from God:
    What reason do you have as a disciple of Jesus Christ to have a bad attitude
    ```json
    {
    "Book": "PSALMS",
    "Chapter": 51,
    "Verse": 13,
    "Text": "Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee."
    }

```
