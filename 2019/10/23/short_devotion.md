### Incentives

[But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.](https://cdn.mintz5.com/801A6BD/linode/bible/PSALMS/4/3)

* God will hear you.

* You get to suffer for his name sake
```json
{
  "Book": "2TIMOTHY",
  "Chapter": 3,
  "Verse": 12,
  "Text": "Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
  }
```

* We are delivered from tempatations
```json
{
  "Book": "2PETER",
  "Chapter": 2,
  "Verse": 9,
  "Text": "The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"
  }
```

### Take away

Being godly is a concious effort to stay in tune with the Holy Spirit
```json
{
  "Book": "JOHN",
  "Chapter": 15,
  "Verse": 4,
  "Text": "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me."
  }
```

Its not a one and done thing, and pride is the opposite of godliness.  
This devotion does no justice to the topic, but the aforementioned are still true.  
Focus on just these for now,  
Remember when you used to be a soldier, all geared up, ready to go on your next mission, its like that  
Gear up, remember your training, know that you have a commander who is all powerful, always be ready for inspection
