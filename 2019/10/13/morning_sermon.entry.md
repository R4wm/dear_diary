# An oximoronic axiom

Text: [2 Cor 9 6-12](http://localhost:8000/bible/2CORINTHIANS/7)

```
6 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.

8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:

9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.

10 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)

11 Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.

12 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;

John D Rockerfeller was not happy,
  History records the misery he experienced
  Youd think hed be happy..
  When he dided, he could not take any of it
  John D R. said something about his life being like thesand castles  o nthe beach..
  He later on started to give
  He helped hospitals, universities
  His contribution aided in the discovery of Pennecilin
  So he changed his thinking from getting to giving
  He then began to enjoy life 
  When he was 53, it seemsed he would lnot live another year
  He then started living according to the truths of God, to give..
  he live to be 97. 45 extra years!
  His life was changed by giving

    He said become useful
    he gave over 500 million dollars
    Before learning this secret of life, he was a taker..
    Research his life before this change in his life.

### Take away
* Oh that cobra you keep thinking about, have you prayed about it? Maybe God doesnt want that for you. Be willing to accept this and take joy 

* This is a message i did NOT want to hear, but its one that I needed. Thank you Lord, help me to do this

* Learn how to give.. Learn how to do it sooner than later.

* Lord please help me to not seek pleasure in `things`, I know im guilty of this. Please help me to remember this day, this commitment im making to lean only on you, and to be like you, who gave.
