## The faith of a child <!-- (I title this) -->

### Notes
---
```
17 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.
```
* the disciples cant please God right now
* perverse is to change the meaning of something (twist)
* The disciples could not remove the demon
* The disciples were mostly focused "whos gonna be the greatest in heaven"
```
1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,

3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
```
* consider the faith it took to do this as a grown man
* Children love their parents
* Children know their parents have all power (to them)
** Dad, could you wrestle a bear?? lol.
* Children depend upon their parents

```
27 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
```


#### notes to self
* you need to release control and be as a little child in the sight of God
* Consider how a child looks to their father
* Children have the ability to just love unbiasedly, where am i pointing my childrens love to as their father? I need to make sure i direct them correctly.
* Micah always tends to love the things that i love. Remember when you liked the GT500? Micah moved from the Hellcat Challenger to the GT500. Why do you think?
* Your kids watch you
* I ought to love the things the Lord loves, and make it contageous to my children.
* Remember that time booboo waited for you in your bed? To make sure you coming home?

* Its never too late, its never a bad time, just do it.
