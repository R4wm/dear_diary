The death burial and ressurectoin of Jesys Christ

does the story grow old for me ?
```
1peter2:24
24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
```

```
32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
```

### surrendering
Simon surrendered his life that day to carry his cross..

1. When is the last time you surrendered your life to the Lord
-- surrendering is an everyday thing. Not just that time you gave your life Jesus Christ.
2. when is the last time God moved in your life? 
3. Purge
4. Not that Jesus needed Simon to help with the cross, Jesus wanted that man..
- I agree Jesus most definately didnt need Simon, but who was Simon? do a study.


```
Matt 16:
24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
```
^^ The christian life in a nutshell.


-- No other was ever beaten more than Jesus Christ.
-- would like to study Roman torture to get an idea
-- comes to mind that excruciating comes from the word crucifiction

```
Proverbs 25:4
4 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
```

2Timothy 2
purge yourself, meet for the masters use.
cleaned up

## notes to self
-- work on your humility. 
-- catch pride when it begins and squash it. 
-- Remind yourself that the creator of this universe humbled himself..
-- how much greater was he!
