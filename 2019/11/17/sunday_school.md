## Notes
- Money and things will not make up for your time with kids
- Teach them to give and to share
  - Of what is theirs
    - Cultivating a giving spirit
    - Ephesians 4:28 to do the opposite of the thing that they want to revert..
  - YOu want your children to be a blessing to others.
  
- Selfish kids will get what they can.

- Who is my neigbor
  - Luke 10:30
  - 
  ```
    30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
    ```
  - The philosophy of the theif is "What is yours i mine and ill will take"
  - The philosophy of the levite is "What is mine is mine and I will keep"
  - The philosophy of the " " is "What is mine is yours, I will share" (Willing to be a giver)

- Emphasize the positive
  - All they days of the afflicted are evil..
  - Is the mood of your home one of thankfulness ? 
  - He that is of merry heart is a feast.
  
- Be careful what TV you allow them to watch
  - Most of the actors (rolls) on TV are not good examples.
  - Psalm 101:3
  ```
  3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
  ```
  - Proverbs 29:17
  ```
  PROVERBS 29 : 17
Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.
  ```
  - We as parents need to be vigilant b/c there is so many ways your children are influenced.
  
  - Be vigilant, it doesnt take much
    - If you have an 8 foot fence, but there is a small hole, your dog will still get out..
    
- Dont expect instance results
  - This is a long term process, duh..
