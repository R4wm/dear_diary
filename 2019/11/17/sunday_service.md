## This aint a country club
[Ephesians 1:15-23](https://bible.mintz5.com/bible/ephesians/1)
```
15 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,

16 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;

17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:

18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,

21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:

22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,

23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

## Notes
- God has alot to say about the church
  - the church is designed by God to be unique (a biblical church)

- In a country club, you:
  - have to be a member..
  - show up when you want
  - use it or not..
  - whatever works best for you
  - people view the church the same way
  - get involved or not
  - membership is about recieving

- A biblical church is not like the above
  - you dont have to guess
  
Ep2:19 Jesus is the cornerstone  
Ep4:11 the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry  
1Cor:12 you are the body of christ, the body is many members  
```
18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
```
Col1:18 Jesus is the head of the body, the church..  
- Love is fundamental
  John13:34 love one another,  (foundational to the church working)  
  1John4: love one another  
  1John3:18 love in deed and truth  
  1John4:7-8 he that loveth not knoweth not God  
  1Thes3:12 abound in love one toward another  
  Rom 13:8 to the church of Rome, love one another ..  
      you owe them your love
  Jesus Commanded it!
  - The church is not a museum for saints, but a hospital for sinners.  

- Church is not a performance or a presentation.
  - its christians living the truth.
  - Matt20:26
    - whosoever shall be great, let him serve
    ```
    28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
    ```
  - God measures greatness by how you serve.
  - Matt16:24
    - deny himself and follow me.
    - lose your life to find it
    - if you try to find your life you will lose it
    - this is anti gimme gimme gimme ..
    - Mark10:31 the first shall be last, the last shall be first
    
- His people coming together to love God and server others
  - this is the church
  - sing songs of praise
  - live out the truth in the community
  - a living body that functions
  
- You dont need the church to get saved
  - the church cant save you
  - Only Jesus can save you 
  - Only Jesus can forgive sin forever

<!-- TAKE AWAY -->
<!--------------->
## Take Away
Love each other  
Forgive one another  
Dont let people (in the church) change what God expects from his members (Memeber of the body)  

Weep with others, share their burdens.  
Rejoice with them who rejoice  

Stop just leaving right after church, start asking God what he wants you to do
