# Notes

- The Mega Church
  - whoever has the biggest crowd.. 
  - using worldy things to appeal to the people
  - "we want the church to look like a mall.." 
    - this was an actual quote from a mega church pastor
  - Does not prortray the church from the Bible
  

```
11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.

12 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;

13 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
```

- pastor said about this verse "you dont need to start a **new** fad"
```
26 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
```
- It seems he does not agree witht this or something


- http://localhost:8000/bible/1corinthians/16
  - In pauls letters, this person that person, they fellowshiped one with another
  - They interacted with one another
  - They supplied for one another..
  - 
  
- 2CORINTHIANS 1
  - Paul is talking about the trials and persecutions
  - youve grown from that,
  - now your able to help other people who will deal with trials to
  - Dont waste those trials
  
  
  
- Church is the people coming together to help each other 
  - if church doesnt change your lives..
    - JAMES 1 : 22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
  - live out your faith in the community.
  - the teachings of the bible need to get past the church walls, else what good is it
  
```
MATTHEW 5 : 16
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
```

- the church like everything else to the christian is to glorify God!
  
- All the works that are spoken of among the members of the church doesnt make you a christian
  - The very beginning of a christian is giving their life to Jesus, being forgiven of their sins.
  - Good works are as filthy rags to God
  ```
  ISAIAH 64:6

But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
  ```
  
  
  
  
- notice how the people of the church get together
http://localhost:8000/bible/TITUS/3  


- more examples of the members of the church willing to laying down their lives for one another
http://localhost:8000/bible/romans/16  

```
4 Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
```

- Jesus is the justifier
```
ROMANS 3 : 26
To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
```

<!-- TAKE AWAY -->

## Take Away

Pastor is going on about how christians shoould have a reputation of mercy and compassion, im not sure how this ties into the title of the message  

Jesus is the justifier
