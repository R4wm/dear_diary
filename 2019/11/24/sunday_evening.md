## Notes

- we are sinners, always will be until we enter heaven
- Heb 10:19
  - having boldness (b/c you are seen without sin due to Jesus)
  - The old testament, they entered into th holy place with great fear
  - If youve been forgiven, you should have a clear conscience.
  
  ```
  HEBREWS 10 : 22
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
  ```
  - Sometimes we as people tend to linger in guilt.. its unbiblical.
  - You were never worthy of salvation
  - You were never worthy of Gods mercy
  - God gave it to you freely, if you accepted it..
  
Gal 3:2   
- its not by what you can do  
  - `This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?`

1John 3:20  **Your forgiveness is not based on your work**
- your heart is going to condemn you
- Gods word is right, your heart is deceitful
- `For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.`
- its based upon His promises, not your doings (your good works are as filthy rags)


James 5:11  
Psalms 103:12  
- God is pitiful on those who fear him

Prov 3:11
- God corrects whom he loves

```
14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
```

**Man is just dust**

```
14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
```
```
GENESIS 2:7

And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
```

```
PSALMS 104:29

Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
```
- Your real worth is in Jesus Christ
- It doesnt matter how much respect youve had on earth, in the end you will stand before almighty God, (who is a respector of no persons)

1Peter 1:24 says life is as grass (grass doesnt live that long)  

James 1:9
- Every man will die, doesnt matter how great or how wealthy  

**Redeem the time**

```
PSALMS 90:12

So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
```
- soon cut off  
```
PSALMS 90:10

The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
```

**Work to store riches in heaven, dont worry about perishable things on this world**
- The dog doesnt know its gonna die  
- Do you know that everything you have here will perish  
- Where is your treasure? will it perish? or will it be eternal  


<!--------------->
<!-- TAKE AWAY -->
<!--------------->
## Take away
Dont focus on this world or this life  
Your riches which can never be taken away are stored in heaven  
Consider the dog, which doesnt know its gonna die  
Number your days b/c being honored of men is vanity, only things for Gods glory matters  
Dont go to heaven alone, take someone with you  
What are you doing??
