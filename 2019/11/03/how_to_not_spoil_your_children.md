# How to not spoil your children
[Numbers 11](https://bible.mintz5.com/bible/NUMBERS/11)

Complaining:
Consider how often you will complain without even noticing  

---

Thankfulness:
whats getting our attention  
As a man thinketh in his heart so is he  
```
PROVERBS 23:7

For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.
```

## Notes:
1. Start with you  
   YOu need to be thankful for your blessings  
   The jews in the wilderness got used to their blessings to the point they were no longer thankful  
   So many miracles in their journey  
   Their shoes never gave out  
   There were no feeble in their group  

* Lets consider how blessed we truly are.
* Your children being happy should not be your number 1 goal  
  Teach them to appreciate

### Take Away
Lots of examples about how people could not go a day without complaining..  
THere was a study, where the professor could not find a student who could not pass the test of not complaining

* I will make an effort to see how often I complain, then purpose to please the Lord in this thing.
