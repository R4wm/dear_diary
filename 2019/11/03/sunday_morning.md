# What is the church?

```
15 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.

## Notes
* Acts 19:23
individual assemblies for the teaching of the word of God.  
Doctrine  
  What the church teaches and believed
>Jude1:3
*The faith*  
Talks about the false doctrine  
earnestly contend

>Doctrine is so important
Acts20:28
```
28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
```
people will bring in false doctrine when Im gone.  
Stand up for right doctrine  

Titus1:8
Titus, you have to make sure the right doctine is being taught.  
Holding fast the faithful word  
```
9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:

11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

12 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;

HOSEA 4:6

My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
```

```
1TIMOTHY 1 : 3
As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
```

"Hey timothy, this is important, teach doctrine correctly, when Im there ill help and encourage"
```

1TIMOTHY 4 : 13
Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
```

* Matthew 18:20
  When 2 or 3 are gathered..  
  This doesnt constiture a church  

* Preach the word in truth

Paul was concerned that people would be gullable to a false doctrine "Another Jesus"
http://localhost:8000/bible/2CORINTHIANS/11/4?json=false

Trust what God has done for you, not what you can do for Jesus  

Its very simple, people will try to pull you away from the simplicity of the Gospel  

If paul was cross checked with Gods word, every Pastor ought to be  

*You need to study the Word*  


>There is 1 truth
*Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.*  
*He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.*  

>Church is
where the gospel is proclaimed
