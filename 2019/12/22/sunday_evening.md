# Is your Jesus still in the manger?
- Luke 2:1-7

```
1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.

2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)

3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)

5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.

6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.

7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

## Notes
- For some christians, the most vivid reality of Jesus is the baby in a manger..
- How (real) is your personal relationship with the Lord
  - Heb 4:14
  - We have the priviledge of coming to him
  ```
  HEBREWS 10 : 19
Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
  ```
  - God wants us to dwell in the secret place
  ```
  PSALMS 91:1

He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
  ```
- Worship means to feel in the heart - Tozier  
  - YOu cannot worship a being you cannot trust
  

- What do you glory in, there is only one thing to glory in
```
JEREMIAH 9 : 24
But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD.
```

- Love mercy
- Do justly

- One thing is needful
  - Luke 10:42
    - Are you like Martha ? or like Mary?
    - Martha wasnt doing anything **bad**
    - Mary chose to spend time with Jesus..  
    
- Mark 3
  - That they might be with him
  - To send them out 
<!--------------->
<!-- TAKE AWAY -->
<!--------------->
## Take Away
- If your pursuit of Jesus was anything like you learning how to ride or how to code..
- Stop being lazy, ask God to help you give him everything and attempt to seek God with all your heart (again)
- Do you ponder Gods word, did you even read enough to begin to ponder ?
- Do you read daily?? (Not really)

```
PSALMS 48 : 14
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
