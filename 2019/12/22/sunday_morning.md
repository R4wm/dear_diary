# The majesty of the mystery

<!-- NOTES -->
<!----------->
## Notes
- The other Gospels dont prepare for the chistmas story
- Mary and Joseph are not really mentioned in books like Matthew
- John starts with "In the beginning"
  - Gives us a look as Jesus before he was even born
  - Here Jesus is called the Word
    - Words are used to communicate with others
  - The word was made flesh
  - He came to live with us, so that we could live with Him.

- Heb 1
  - Who Jesus is
    - Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high
    
- Sometimes when people cant comprehend they tend to reject
  - God has always been
  - How big is outer space
    - unlimited some would say
    - there is a boundry some would say
    
  - Neither are comprehendable
    - Do we say that outer space does not exist? 
  - Jesus said its blessed to believe who have not seen
    - 29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

```
COLOSSIANS 1 : 15
Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
```
- Jesus created the worlds

Jer 10:10  
```
JEREMIAH 10 : 12
He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
```
- There will never be another God
Is 43:10  
```
ISAIAH 43 : 10
Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
```

- You cant possibly do enough good works to make it into heaven

<!-- TAKE AWAY -->
<!--------------->
## Take Away
- Jesus came to destroy the power of the devil
  - another study
```
ISAIAH 43 : 10
Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
```
- God clothed himself with human flesh and live and died among us that we might be saved if we believe on Him.
