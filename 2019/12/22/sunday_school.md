RUTH 1 : 19
So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

20 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
```

## Notes

- Life will not go as you plan
  - You determine the quality of you life by how you respond to those
  - Life got bitter for Naomi
  
- For Joseph life went bad for doing right..
  - He didnt give in to Potifers wife
    - Gen 39:7
    - Your sin is against God..
      ```
      9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
      ```
    - No one would have even known. His heart was right so he had the right response
    - He was tempted daily
  - Note: Joseph was not killed for this type of accusation
    - God protection
    - He was a faithful worker
      - He was such a good worker that he was promoted to the highest position
  - He was in prison for 2 years for this
    - Gen 40:13
  - God restored things so well for Joseph
    ```
    GENESIS 41 : 51
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
    ```
  - Manasseh
    - God caused me to forget all my toil
  - Ephraim
    - God has caused me to be fruitful



- If you wanna focus on the bad side of things, all your days will be evil
  ```
  PROVERBS 15:15

All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.
  ```

<!-- TAKE AWAY -->
<!--------------->
## Take awak

- Was Joseph wrong for not doing anything about it for the days that the wife was tempting him?
- Maybe he didnt know that there was no one in the house that day - Gen 39:11
- Manasseh
  - For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
