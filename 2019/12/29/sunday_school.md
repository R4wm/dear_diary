*Gen 45:1-3*  

```
1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.

2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.

3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.

# Things dont go the way you want part 2


## Notes
- We talked about Naomi in the last study, now we study Joseph
- Joseph had alot of reaasons to be "bitter"
- He went through a alot, God blesses Joseph
  - 20 years ago (from his rule) he was sold by his brothers
  
- In verse 5 Joseph says dont  be grieved about what you did (to his brothers)
  - Joseph recognizes that this was all in Gods hands
  - we add to evil by overcoming evil with evil 
  ```20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
```

- Josephs respnse was right

- Its Gods place to deal with vengence, not yours
```
GENESIS 50 : 19
And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
```

- Hope defferd maketh the heart sick
  - when you set your expectations..
  

*Habakkuk 3*
```
17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:

18 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.

19 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
```

## Take Away
- Let it go
  - Keep your eyes on Jesus, He is good
  - God knows everything
  
## Questions
- Joseph did play with his brothers  in the beginning.. whats up with that?
- Job also did at one time question God..

```
JOB 1:22

In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
