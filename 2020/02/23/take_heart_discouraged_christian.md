# Take heart discouraged christian

### Romans 7:9-19

<!----------->
<!-- NOTES -->
<!----------->
## Notes
- BG: Paul is being very transparent, sharing his stuggles
  - 2Cor 11:
    - We think of Paul as a super christian,
    - He was literally the man (as a top notch pharisee)

- ```24 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.```
  - Would you go back into the ministry if you went through what Paul went through ? 
  
- The part of Paul that we would not see if not for Romans 7
  - For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
    - I dont think this means that he was a menace or somtehing like that, but maybe he could still see his sinful nature, and being so in touch with God, that every spot stuck out to him.
    - Paul is saying "I really have to battle with my flesh."
      - And he loses that battle sometimes
        - ```15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.```
    - 
      
- sometimes you may wonder "Am I even saved?"
  - This is not to minimize sin
  - Paul hated his sin
  - 
  
- Remember that Gods mercies are always ready for you
  - ```LAMENTATIONS 3:23
They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.```
  - Instead of being so discouraged, be motivated to call on God and prepare your day in prayer.
  - You will always need God and his word, you will never get to the point that you sin not.
