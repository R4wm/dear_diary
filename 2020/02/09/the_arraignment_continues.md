*Malachi 1:6-10*  
```
6 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?

7 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.

8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.

9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.

10 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.

## Notes

- John 14:21: God says why call me Lord if you wont let me be your Lord, and that the man who loves me will obey me.
    - Ill do what you want Lord, but dont ask me to .. __fill in the blank__
    - 
    
- In verse 6, God is saying that their offering is evil.
  - If you had guests over for dinner, would you pull out some rotten food for them?
  - God is not happy with your left overs
    - Its actually an offense!
  - Its easy to identify when someone blasphemes Gods name in public, but there is the same offense when you dont give God your best.

## Take Away
Are you giving God your best?  
When you get dressed for church, you should put your best into it  
This doesnt mean you need to have an expensive suit and tie, but you ought to dress your best for Him.   
Everything you offer to God should be your best.  
Do you go to bed early on Saturday so you can be your best on Sunday?

GENESIS 35 : 2
Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
```

yes there is a balance: 1Peter 3  
1Tim 2:9-10  

Ex. 28:39 God required beauty in his worship  
"Thats for the priests".. see Num. 15:37-38  

Yes there is a balance, you can be dressed up and not be right on the inside  
```
MATTHEW 23:27

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
