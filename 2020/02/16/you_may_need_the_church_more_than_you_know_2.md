# you may need the church more than you know
*Hebrews 10:24-35*  

```
23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)

24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:

25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.

## Notes
- Romans 15
  - we are to bear the infirmities of the weak
  - helping both the giver and the receiver
  - Proverbs 19:17
    - He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.
  - God wants us to think of others
  
- put yourself in their position
  - (missed the verse)
  
- Rejoice with others in their rejoicing, suffer with them that suffer
  - Note: it may be hard to rejoice when they rejoince ( when your having abad day)
  - 
  
- Paul is asking the church to remember his bonds
  - would you pray that while im here, God would give me the opportunity to serve him here?
  
- Heb 10:34
  - when a church is what its supposed to be, its people will be proactive (in deed)
```
34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.

```  

- Church is not enough
  - Keep investing into your daily personal walk with Jesus
  - 
  
- Hebrews 3,4,5
  - Jesus has been through all tempations (and without sin)
  - He can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities
    - YOu have to bring it to him
    - He came down and lived among his creation
    - He died for his creation, (not for his sin, he had no sin)
      - That we may be forgiven of all sin that we can be with him forever.
    ```
    HEBREWS 5 : 2
Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.

## Take away

```
GALATIANS 6 : 1
Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
```  
I cant think of anyone except Pastor Esposito who has reached out in a time of need.
