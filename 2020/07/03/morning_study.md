# Proverbs 3

- Wisdom is more precious than rubies
  - length of days in her right hand 
    - the right hand always carries more weight than the left in bible 

- Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
  - "sudden" stood out to me, reminds me of how the covid pandemic seems to have come from nowhere
    - we are commanded to not be afraid (to the christian (who is right with right with God?)) 
    
-  Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
   - All the news of BLM, we are seeing people  picking fights with people (falsle accusations) to ruin their lives
   - We as christians are called to be peace makers , not antogonists.
