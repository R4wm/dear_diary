## Notes

- 1Peter2
  - but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
    - God called us to suffer (for good)
      - This is not to mistake with being called to suffer for your own wrongs
  - Jesus was our example
    - How did Jesus suffer?
      - He did no sin
    - **He had perfect control of his tongue**

- Psalms 15
  - Stick to your word
    - regardless of the situation
      - In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.
      
- Luke 23
  - Jesus is dying for our sins, enduring torment
  - In this most outrageous time of trial, see how Jesus handled the situation
    - Jesus didnt return the mockery
  - Humanly speaking, you cant do this, let people wrong you and let it be
    - You can do this b/c your saviour did, he is our example.
    - I am no better than my saviour

- Psalms 17
  - God is using these wicked men to work on me
    - David is saying Im ok with you using evil men to teach me to be like you


- 1Cor 6:1-5
  - choose to be ok with being wronged
