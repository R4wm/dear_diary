- its an exercise to control where your mind goes
  - Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;

- anger starts in the heart (among your other emotions)

- we are gonna have to purpose in our heart our attitude

- no matter how much time you spend in the past, you cannot change it 
  - When you think about the negative things of the past, you are likely to be sad, bitter, etc
    - Dont waste the day with your regrets of the past.
      - dont go through life fearful, worrying about it wont do much

- Matth 6:25-27
  - Dont be stressed out
    - This is not to say dont take care, but rather dont waste time worrying.
  - You dont have to worry, God is capable of taking care of you (his children)
    - This is not to say you should tempt the Lord

22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:

23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.

24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
```
- Acts 20:22-24
  - Paul is saying I dont know whats gonna happen, but its all good
    - None of these things move me!
