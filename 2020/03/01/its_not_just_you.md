- Paul is transparent in his writings
  - 2Cor 7:5 (many verses here where Paul shares his troubles)
  - Phil 2:25
    - sorrow upon sorrow...
    
- Romans 7
  - He is very trasparent about his struggles here


- Galatians 5:17 
  - For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
  - You will always have to deal with the flesh
    - my anger
    - my pride
    - etc..
    
- You cant get saved again, you cant lose salvation you never earned (it was a gift recieved)
  - Romans 10:13
  - Eph 2:8
    - For by grace are ye saved through faith...
  - John 6:37
    - All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
  - You can repent, ask God to wash you and prepare you again

- We are not all the children of God
  - Jesus told "religious" people, ye are of your father the Devil.
    - These woulhd have been moraly good people..
    
- Grow in your christian life
  - 2Peter 1
    - And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
  - Dont get so far in sin you forget you are a child of God    
    - But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
  - Dont ever think "You have arrived" in your christian life.
  




### Take away
- There is no good thing in our flesh
  - 
  
- When you fall, get back up
- Keep going!
- If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.

```18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.

19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.

20 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.

21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.

22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.

24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.```
