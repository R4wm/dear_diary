Malachi 1:1-10

## Notes
- malachi and nehemiah are similar, same timeline
  - God was telling the people that they were just going through the motions with their _fake_ offerings.
  - We can do the samething today where we just show up, and our heart is not in it.
  - The "Everything and everyone is ok message" Mal 2:17
    - 17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?

- Its better to be totally wicked than to be lukewarm
  - Its easy for people who are doing "ok" to decieve themselves
    - Rev 3:16
      - 16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.
  - The person who **knows** they are wicked will have a better reflection because they can be honest with themself.
  - God knows __half hearted worship__

```
HOSEA 7:2

And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.
```
  
      
- The disciples ask about Elias, he was supposed to come first?
  - Jesus refers to John the Baptist
    - John did not see himself to be compared to Elijah
    - John minimised who he was and preached about the Messiah (Jesus)

## Takeaway
- why does John the Baptist have the Holy Spirit from birth?
  - 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
  
- Is your worship half hearted?
