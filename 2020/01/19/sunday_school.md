## Notes
- Bowls of mercy
  - it doesnt matter how someone treats you
  - Let the peace of God rule in your hearts
  
- Acts 12
  - Peter throughout the bible has said and done the wrong things
  - But in acts 12 we see that he  is hard to even wake (before his execution) verse 6
  - 7 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
  
- Mark6:45
    - before, they saw Jesus feed the multitude with the fish and loaves
    - They considered not the miracle cause their heart was hard
