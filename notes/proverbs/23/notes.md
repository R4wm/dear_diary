# [Proverb 23](https://bible.mintz5.com/bible/PROVERBS/23)

- Know your audience, know your surroundings
- Know your weaknesses
- for they are deceitful meat
  - food is probably one of the best things in life, there is nothing better than to eat drink and be merry, 
    - yet the bible calls the kings meat deceitful, how much more the pretty things of this world?
      - motorcycles
      - gorgeous machines

- Dont focus on trying to become rich
- The bible teaches over and over to not lean on your own wisdom/understanding
